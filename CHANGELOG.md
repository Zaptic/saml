## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   Started the changelog
-   forceAuthNByDefault boolean in service provider preferences.
    It is the for the optional `forceAuthentication` boolean of the `buildLoginRequestRedirectURL()` function.
    This should be used when you want to forceAuthentication by default without passing a boolean each time to
    `buildLoginRequestRedirectURL()` but still be able to sometimes not force the authentication
    By default it is `false` - this preserves the backwards compatibility.
